                  <p>In the wake of the recent terror attacks in Western Europe (Jan 2015 and Nov 2015 in Paris; Mar 2016 in Brussels), I started observing the dynamics of the European society's reaction to events of this kind. I find it remarkable how impactful these events seem on both the general public, including political decisions, the rise and fall of political parties, and mass-media coverage, and people in my personal social circles. One of the oldest, most important emotions in the whole animal kingdom seems to be the prime reason behind the vehement, sometimes even violent, reactions: fear.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I will examine where this fear comes from and why it is absolutely understandable - but most importantly, I will show my reasoning as to why it is both <strong>irrational and dangerous to be afraid of terrorism in Western Europe</strong>.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY --></p>
<h2>General human risk-assessment mechanisms</h2>
<p>Human intuition is without a doubt one of the greatest achievements in the history of evolution. Paired with some strategical thinking, it helps us to quickly make decisions without having to consider every possible action. Intuition allows us to play the game of Go nearly as well as <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.se/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html">a computer network consisting of 1202 processors and 176 graphics cards</a>, to learn and speak languages fluently (even those with a highly complicated underlying grammatical structure), or to evaluate risks the second they manifest. However, despite its usefulness, human intuition is definitely not flawless, especially in situations that are relatively new to mankind (i.e., that have not been around for thousands of years). Luckily, we have reason to deal with these cases, but this requires some more work.</p>
<p>One particular thing that humans are generally pretty bad at is making decisions that may have a life-changing impact when small probabilities are involved. When using simple intuition, the actual probability (whether given or estimated from a frequency of events) becomes less and less important the more extreme it gets, and the outcome of the decision becomes dominated by all kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias">biases</a>.</p>
<p>One example where (biased) intuition is present is gambling. Any commercial gambling operator has to be sustainable and thus make money, so every gamble of pure chance will be designed in a way that favors the operator. The most popular lottery in Germany, <em>Lotto 6 aus 49</em> (comparable to the US-American <em>Powerball</em>), with around 21 million weekly players, offers a chance of 139,838,160 to 1 to win the jackpot of averagely 9 million Euro. One lottery ticket is currently priced at 1€, but the mean winning money (including all winning categories) lies at only 50ct. To make this clear: instead of buying a lot of lottery tickets, you might as well shove half of your money out of the window (with the possible side effect of making some homeless people's day)<sup>1</sup>. So, why are people even playing the lottery (or even worse, slot machines and alike)? The answer is biases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outcome bias</strong>: the notion to only take into account the possible outcomes of the decision (i.e., buying a lottery ticket), while disregarding or misjudging their corresponding likelihood. <em>Either you win, or you lose</em>, or also: <em>winning the jackpot makes my life much better, while spending 1€ on the ticket barely affects me</em>.</li>
<li>Some sort of <strong>selection bias</strong>: Someone winning the lottery will be reported on the news (or will at least be talked about in their social environment), and winning the lottery has a huge emotional impact. This is why we tend to ignore the millions of losers while focusing on a few winners, and put ourselves in their shoes.</li>
<li>(Non-)<strong>zero-risk bias</strong>: If one doesn't play the lottery, there is no way they can win - buying a ticket will give them a chance at the jackpot, how slim it may be (even though the money could be spent better). <em>Someone is going to win the lottery, so it could as well be me</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Both biases are naturally strongest when considering low-probability, high-impact events.</p>
<h2>The reasons behind a fear of terrorism</h2>
<p>I have chosen playing the lottery as an example for a simple intuitive risk-assessment because most people can relate to it; but of course, the exact same analysis can be applied to events that are very unlikely, but have a huge <em>negative</em> impact, such as a terroristic attack. All that is needed is to re-label some terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>winning the lottery becomes being killed or injured in an attack (low probability)</li></li>
<li>not winning the lottery becomes not being involved in an attack (high probability)</li></li>
<li>buying a lottery ticket becomes leaving the house (assuming you are safe at home, and putting yourself at risk in public spaces) </li>
</ul>
<p>Applying the exact same analysis as before:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outcome bias</strong>: Going outside can get you killed, while staying at home seems safe, whatever the chances are.</li>
<li><strong>Selection bias</strong>: Without a doubt, terrorist attacks and their victims receive massive media attention, triggering human empathy, and making terrorist attacks seem like something that could happen to anyone, anytime.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-risk bias</strong>: People would rather reduce the risk of being killed in an attack to zero (by staying at home) than taking this slim risk and, e.g., quit smoking (which increases life expectancy by a much larger amount, but does not eliminate the risk of falling ill with lung cancer entirely).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these cognitive biases are by far not the whole truth why terrorist attacks are scary. One very important aspect is also the lack of feeling in charge or being familiar with the situation. This is also the main reason why people tend to be much more scared of crashes with an airplane compared to crashes with a car. In an airplane, or a terrorist attack, there is nothing much you can do apart from praying or running for your life, while in a dangerous situation involving a car you have the <em>illusion</em> of being in charge (obviously, there are many car accidents that no one saw coming, or were able to prevent).</p>

                	<h1><a href="dionhaefner.github.io/creating-a-science-conference-poster-with-inkscape.html">Creating a Science Conference Poster with Inkscape</a></h1>
                  <h2>First things first</h2>
<p>This poster design is heavily based on the poster template provided by <a href="http://blog.felixbreuer.net/2010/10/24/poster.html">Felix Breuer</a>. Many thanks to him for creating such a beautiful and unusual poster from scratch, and even publishing the template for others to use. Accordingly, this modification is published under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a> as well, which means that you are free to use and modify this template in any fashion you would like, as long as you give credit to the original authors and publish your modification as a template, too.</p>
<h2>Our poster</h2>
<p>This poster was created during a MSc level physics course on climate at Heidelberg University as final project. We were given a paper (that we are in no way affiliated with) from climate research and told to create a poster that would be well-suited to represent the contents of the paper at a conference. Our goal was to create a poster that stands out in the mass of standard, blocky posters that physicists tend to create. Additionally, we wanted the poster layout to tell a story, so you would not have to read the whole poster to understand what was going on - we wanted the plots and figures and some short summary to convey the most important ideas at a glance.</p>
<p><a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> seemed to be the perfect tool for this task, since it is free, has powerful vector tools, and is based on visuals rather than code. So, this is what we came up with: <a href="https://www.dionhaefner.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/low-res.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-48" src="https://www.dionhaefner.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/low-res-1024x738.png" alt="" width="960" height="692" /></a> (you can download the SVG version of the poster below)</p>
<h3>Design choices</h3>

<p>We took over most of the basic ideas from Felix Breuer's poster. However, his poster was clearly a math poster: little text, many formulae, rather sketches and drawings than plots. The design he chose fitted the 'math style' exceptionally well, but did not really seem suitable for a poster from environmental physics, since we had completely different requirements. So we made the following changes to the original design:</p>

<ul>
<li>The color scheme was changed. The original blue-and-grey scheme was pretty, but we wanted to use somewhat lighter colors, and match the color scheme used by our faculty (red and white). However, the original idea of applying a color gradient to any surface remains unchanged, and leads to a nice illusion of depth.</li>
<li>Our poster would be much more text-heavy, so we needed more space for the text boxes around the edges of the poster. We chose a larger font than Felix Breuer did (28 instead of 24) to make the wall of text seem less intimidating (and to prevent ourselves from writing too much text).</li>
<li>Probably the most notable difference is the different tile structure in the middle of the poster. A circular pattern did not seem reasonable in our case: We would have to include quite a few rectangular figures, so a circle would take away too much usable space. Instead, we decided on a flattened U-shape, which still had the original spirit of Felix Breuer's poster (explain everything with the plots in the center).</li>
<li>As the poster's structure is highly unusual, many readers were confused as of where to begin to read, and where to continue. We tried to make this intuitively clear by adding as many arrows and visual hints as possible. This way, only very few people tried to read downwards from the block at the upper-left corner, and pretty much everyone found their way towards the right hand side of the poster.</li>
<li>The summary block was moved from the middle to the top of the poster. This spot is definitely not perfect, since it distorts the reading flow of a reader that starts at the upper-left of the poster as the arrows indicate. After reading the first block, the reader will arrive at the summary block instead of the block at the upper-right. Other ideas would be to move the summary to the middle of the poster again, or put it as a first block right above the title of the poster (or omit it entirely).</li>
<li>We added a QR code created <a href="http://www.qrdesign.net/en/generate/url">here</a> (which features some short text/advertisement while redirecting when using their free plan - we did not find this particularly annoying, but if it bothers you, just pay for it, create the code yourself, or create a code without a background image) linking to the paper our work was based on. We found this a nice gimmick, especially with the logo in the background, since one could immediately tell where they would end up after scanning the code. However, I doubt many people would actually scan it on a conference, and you could just omit it.</li>
<li>We were experimenting with different effects on the poster's title and our names. At first, we used a much larger drop shadow, but we found the contrast at these places to be quite low. This certainly got better by using a sharper shadow, but you could consider removing it entirely.</li>
<li>We typeset all texts directly in inkscape and created hidden boxes that we flowed the text into. There might be a more elegant way to do this, but it did the trick. They are all in their own hidden layer, so if you want to change the shape of the flowing text, just show that layer and edit the boxes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Printing</h3>

<p>Following Felix Breuer's suggestion, we exported the poster as a 500-dpi png (i.e., raster image), and printing worked like a charm, although the resulting image was about 40 MB large. Later, we also tried to export the poster as pdf using inkscape's export function, and this seemed to work well, too. Text turned out to be crisp, and all vector plots printed very well - only the QR code and two of the plots, which we did not have in vectorized form, turned out a little blurry, so make sure you get your hands on vectorized versions of anything you want to include.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Creating our poster in inkscape was ...</p>
