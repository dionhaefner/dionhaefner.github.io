## Master's thesis

During my Master's thesis in <a href="http://climate-geophysics.nbi.ku.dk/research/oceanography/" target="_blank">Physical Oceanography at NBI Copenhagen</a>, I ran ocean simulations using the <a href="http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/" target="_blank">CESM</a> climate model. I examined the dependence of cross-equatorial flow and the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) on viscosity close to the western ocean boundaries. My work at NBI was an interesting mixture of modeling, data evaluation, and theory.

My finished thesis, along with the LaTeX sources, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dionhaefner/dionsthesis" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
