## Let me introduce myself

I am a German living in Malmö, Sweden, and I'm currently finishing my studies as a Master’s student in Physics at Heidelberg University, Germany. I have conducted my Master’s project at Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen, as a part of [Team Ocean](http://climate-geophysics.nbi.ku.dk/research/oceanography/) (check out my [research](#research) for more).

During my Bachelor’s at Heidelberg University, I specialized on computational physics, and conducted my thesis project as a member of the [Terrestrial Systems](http://ts.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/) group at IUP, Heidelberg.

Although I have been doing Environmental Physics for a while now, I mostly see myself as a 'computer guy'. I have a passion for software, modeling, and effective communication & visualization.

My personal interests cover a wide range between Coding and Technology, Science, Art and Design, and Pop Culture (and so does my [blog](/blog)). My tools of choice are Ubuntu, Python, Jupyter notebooks, InkScape, LaTeX, and C++.
