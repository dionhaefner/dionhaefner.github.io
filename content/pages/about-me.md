## Let me introduce myself
<img class="img-circle pull-right" style="margin: 20px; max-height: 250px;" src="images/dion.jpg" alt="That's me!">

I am a PhD student in physical oceanography at Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen. Although I have been doing geophysics for a while now, I mostly see myself as a "computer guy". I have a passion for scientific software, modeling, and effective communication & visualization. I live in Malm√∂, Sweden.

At NBI, I am responsible for the development of [Veros](#code-projects), a high-performance ocean model with a special focus on usability.

My personal interests cover a wide range between Coding and Technology, Science, Art and Design, and Pop Culture (and so does my [blog](/blog)). My tools of choice are (among others) Python, Jupyter notebooks, NumPy, Matplotlib, Bohrium, Ubuntu, InkScape, LaTeX, and C++.
