## Let me introduce myself
<img class="img-circle pull-right" style="margin: 20px; max-height: 250px;" src="images/dion.jpg" alt="That's me!">

I am an aspiring scientist living in Malm√∂, Sweden. Although I have been doing geophysics for a while now, I mostly see myself as a "computer guy". I have a passion for scientific software, modeling, and effective communication & visualization.

I currently work as a Scientific Assistant at Niels Bohr Institute (Copenhagen University). At NBI, I am responsible for the development of [Veros](#code-projects), a high-performance ocean model with a special focus on usability.

I have recently graduated with an MSc in Physics from Heidelberg University, Germany. I have conducted [my Master's project](#research) as a part of [Team Ocean](http://climate-geophysics.nbi.ku.dk/research/oceanography/) at NBI, and my Bachelor's thesis project as a member of the [Terrestrial Systems](http://ts.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/) group at the Institute of Environmental Physics, Heidelberg.

My personal interests cover a wide range between Coding and Technology, Science, Art and Design, and Pop Culture (and so does my [blog](/blog)). My tools of choice are (among others) Python, Jupyter notebooks, NumPy, Matplotlib, Bohrium, Ubuntu, InkScape, LaTeX, and C++.
