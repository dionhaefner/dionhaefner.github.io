## Let me introduce myself

I am a PhD student in physical oceanography at Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen.

Although I have been doing geophysics for a while now, I mostly see myself as a "computer guy". I have a passion for scientific software, modeling, statistics / probabilistic machine learning, and effective communication / visualization.

At NBI, I am responsible for the development of [Veros](#code-projects), a high-performance ocean model with a special focus on usability.

My personal interests cover a wide range between Coding and Technology, Science, Art and Design, and Pop Culture. I am a huge fan of the scientific Python ecosystem, and love working with great libraries such as [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax), [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/), [Dask](https://dask.org/), [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/), or [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

I live in Malm√∂, Sweden with my girlfriend and son.
