## Let me introduce myself

I am a master’s student in physics at Heidelberg University, Germany, living in Malmö, Sweden. Currently, I conduct my Master’s project at Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen. As a part of [Team Ocean](http://climate-geophysics.nbi.ku.dk/research/oceanography/), I run ocean simulations using the [CESM](http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/) climate model in order to examine the dependence of the meridional overturning current (MOC) on friction against the western ocean boundary.

During my Bachelor’s at Heidelberg University, I specialized on computational physics, and conducted my thesis project as a member of the [Terrestrial Systems](http://ts.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/) group at IUP, Heidelberg.

My interests cover a wide range between Coding and Technology, Art and Design, Science, and Pop Culture (and so does my [blog](/blog/)). My tools of choice are Python, IPython notebooks, InkScape, some LaTeX, and some C++.
