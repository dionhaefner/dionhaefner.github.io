<h2> Master's thesis </h2>

During my Master's thesis in <a href="http://climate-geophysics.nbi.ku.dk/research/oceanography/" target="_blank">Physical Oceanography at NBI Copenhagen</a>, I ran ocean simulations using the <a href="http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/" target="_blank">CESM</a> climate model. I examined the dependence of cross-equatorial flow and the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) on viscosity close to the western ocean boundaries. My work at NBI was an interesting mixture of modeling, data evaluation, and theory.

My finished thesis, along with the LaTeX sources, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dionhaefner/dionsthesis" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

## Bachelor's thesis

In my Bachelor's thesis, I implemented and benchmarked adaptive grid refinement in a numerical solver for the Richards equation, a partial differential equation describing soil water flow.
