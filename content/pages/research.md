## Master's thesis

I run ocean simulations using the [CESM](http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/) climate model in order to examine the dependence of the meridional overturning current (MOC) on friction against the western ocean boundary. My work consists of some modelling, and a lot of data evaluation.

## Bachelor's thesis

In my Bachelor's thesis, I implemented and benchmarked adaptive grid refinement in a numerical solver for the Richards equation, a partial differential equation describing soil water flow. See also DORiE at [my code projects](#code-projects-content).
