Imagine you are standing on the main deck of a ship, 4m above the water, on a voyage across the Atlantic. The sea is pretty calm. In another situation, your ship

What do both events have in common? Both are examples of *rogue waves*.

A rogue wave is, by definition, any wave that is twice (or sometimes 2.2 times) as high as the significant wave height. So this is what I set out to study for my PhD in Copenhagen.

I wasn't much of a wave expert when I started, and I had barely ever heard the term "rogue wave". So when I began to get into the research literature about them, I was stunned:


## Big data and little data

## Real-world rogue wave probabilities

## The hunt for the white whale

## From association to causation
