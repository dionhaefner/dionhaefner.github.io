    "\n",
    "When encountering the command `\\importpgf`, LaTeX looks up the given file, and writes its contents, along with the preamble from the command `\\@pgfpreamble`, into a temporary file. The command calculates the MD5 checksum of this temporary file and, if it exists, of a corresponding `.tex` file for the given figure that was written during a previous compilation using `\\importpgf`. If the hash matches, the command just returns the PDF file corresponding to the `.tex` file with `\\includegraphics`. Otherwise, the `.tex` file is overwritten with the temporary file, compiled to a PDF, and then returned with `\\includegraphics`. Because of that, the first compilation may take a lot of time (all figures are compiled to PDF one-by-one), but the following compilations should be fast if you don't change any of the figures.\n",
